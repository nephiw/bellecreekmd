# Belle Creek West - New Development

![proposed location of Belle Creek West](/assets/2020/BelleCreekWest.png)

UDC Miller LLC has filed a request to annex and zone the property to the southwest of Belle Creek into Commerce City. They want to build about 47 residential lots for single family homes. They intend to name this neighborhood "Belle Creek West." These homes will connect to Belle Creek via 105th Ave and will also connect to Brighton Rd via Yosemite Way to the south. They hope to start construction in early 2021. The "proposed development is envisioned as an extension to the Belle Creek Neighborhood" at least when it comes to tying into existing streets. 

Commerce City is accepting comments up until April 16th, 2020. Comments can be mailed to:<br/>
