# Belle Creek West - New Development

![proposed location of Belle Creek West](/assets/2020/BelleCreekWest.png)

UDC Miller LLC has filed a request to annex and zone the property to the south-west of Belle Creek into Commerce City as about 47 residential lots to build single family homes. They intend to name this neighborhood "Belle Creek West." These homes will become accessible via 105th Ave into the Belle Creek community and to the south by Yosemite Way that will provide access to Brighton Rd. They hope to start construction in early 2021. The "proposed development is envisioned as an extension to the Belle Creek Neighborhood" at least when it comes to tying into existing streets. 

Commerce city is accepting comments up until April 16th, 2020. Comments can be mailed to:<br/>
