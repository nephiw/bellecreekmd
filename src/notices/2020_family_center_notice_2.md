# Family Center Update

Discussions between the District and the YMCA continue regarding the School Age Program, but the YMCA has confirmed that they will not leave currently enrolled families without childcare.

As for the family center staffing, the District has hired an employment law attorney and will post job openings early next week to begin the staff hiring process.

We are meeting with YMCA management this week to outline the transition of the reservations calendar, rentals, membership, etc. to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible.  As soon as the transition outline is in place, we will be contacting the entities that regularly use the family center for fitness programs.  i.e. Martial Arts, Yoga, Volleyball, Pickleball so that these programs are unchanged.  If you have any questions, please contact Laurie Tatlock.
