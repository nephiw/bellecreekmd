# Defective Shingles

It has been brought to our attention that there is a potential shingle defect on Belle Creek homes built between 2011 and 2018. We have at least one confirmed instance with a new Richmond home.

The defect is with asphalt shingles due to a lack of bond between the granules and the asphalt. Some of the symptoms of this defect include but are not limited to: an extreme amount of granule loss after rain, wind and snow, that builds up on patios, decks and driveways, as well as granule buildup in gutters and downspouts. Furthermore, a "blotchy" or "patchy" look can be noticed on the shingles where granule loss has occurred.

This is primarily a cosmetic defect but there is no guarantee that additional problems could occur in time.

The only way to determine if your shingles are defective is to have them inspected. NCR Roofing is working with Tamko (the shingle manufacturer) on this issue and has re-roofed almost 500 homes with this defect in the last two years and is very familiar with the process. If you are interested in having NCR complete a free inspection or have any questions, please visit the link below.

The following steps would need take place prior to submitting a claim through Tamko:

1. Homeowner must contact NCR to schedule an inspection (see link below).
2. Roof Inspection: If your shingles look to be defective, NCR will remove 2 sample shingles and will take photographic evidence of the defect.
3. Homeowner must file a claim with Tamko and NCR will walk you through the entire claim process.

I hope your home does not have defective shingles, but if it does, this is a good opportunity to get them repaired.
