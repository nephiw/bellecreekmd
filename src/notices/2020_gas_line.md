# Natural Gas Line Update

![](/assets/notices/2020/gas_line_map.png)

Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo, an Xcel Energy Company) has a natural gas pipeline that bisects Belle Creek. This pipeline is located within easements that were established in the 1950s, which in turn, were platted as part of the Belle Creek development. 

Beginning in late 2020, PSCo will begin replacing this gas line. So, to do so, in the immediate future PSCO will have both survey and geotech crews in the area. These crews should have a nominal impact on the infrastructure (parks, sidewalks, etc.) and community in general. <a href="/assets/notices/2020/2020.05.01_MAOP_Project.pdf" target="gas">Here is a flyer that provides a high-level overview of the project.</a>
