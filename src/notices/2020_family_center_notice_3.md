# Family Center Update

The Belle Creek Metro District has officially started hiring! [Job descriptions and applications are posted in this notice](https://bellecreekmd.org/notices/apply-to-work-at-the-family-center/). Please consider applying or forwarding to a qualified friend.

We are also looking into hiring a Transition Facilitator - someone who can work at the Family Center and ease the change. This person will help us build a positive culture. We are trying to make Family Center jobs positions that people want to have and keep, working early to promote this will hopefully lead to a Family Center with respect for the staff and the community.

We continue to have discussions with the YMCA to offer Before and After School child care as well as vacation and summer camps in the Family Center space. We have heard that parents with children in these programs want to keep the same programming and staffing. Our intent is to continue the partnership with the YMCA for School Age child care, but under a different contractual structure. We are working on negotiations.

The District has contacted the instructors for Silver Sneakers, Martial Arts, and Yoga and they are all interested in offering the same programs after we transition to a self-managed facility. We continue to look at what it will take to offer a program similar to alphabet soup and will be hiring teachers to continue the program. The Live Church will continue to offer services in the Family Center.

Belle Creek Metropolitan District No. 1 Board Member, Barbara Southwell, has resigned from her position on the Board.  She intends to serve the community in other ways. Barbara has contributed greatly to our community and her insights, experience, and energy will be missed. Presently, we do not plan on appointing anyone to fill her position.  Her term ends in May and any appointee would need to self-nominate and run for election in less than 2 months.

In an effort to avoid too many emails to people who may not be interested, we have created a signup form to recieve information about the Family Center going forward. Communications about this change will go to people who sign up here: [https://mailchi.mp/36c38ae749b6/family-center-transistion](https://mailchi.mp/36c38ae749b6/family-center-transistion)  Further, if you are interested in learning more about our child care options from socialization programs (like alphabet soup) to day care, please sign up here: [https://mailchi.mp/91ff793c51f8/preschool](https://mailchi.mp/91ff793c51f8/preschool).
