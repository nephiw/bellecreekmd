    <p>
      At the Belle Creek Family Center, we are committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for your
      child. In Alphabet Soup, children will explore colors, shapes, numbers and letters through a blend of
      theme based curriculum and will be encouraged to explore and focus on the importance of community and
      self-expression. This program helps develop self-esteem, communication, fine/gross motor skills and group
      interaction.
