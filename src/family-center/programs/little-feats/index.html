    <p>
      At the Belle Creek Family Center, we are committed to providing a healthy and safe environment for your
      child. In Little Feats Playgroup, children will explore colors, shapes, numbers and letters through a blend of
      theme based curriculum and will be encouraged to explore and focus on the importance of community and
      self-expression. This program helps develop self-esteem, communication, fine/gross motor skills and group
      interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also offer a bring-your-own lunch program we call Little Feats Eats where children will socialize while
      they eat food together. When they are not eating, they will have more time to play with each other, building
      friendships and learning to interact while eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer two seperate programs for potty-trained children ages 3-5:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Little Feats Playgroup (9 am - 11:30 am)</li>
      <li>Little Feats Eats (11:30 am - 1 pm)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rates</h3>
    <div>
      <p>This program has different rates depending upon if you live in the community and if you want your child to
        attend for 2, 3 or 5 days per week. To sign up, go to the Family Center and speak to the front desk. This
        process will be smoothed out over the next few weeks or months.</p>
