    <h3>What is Pickleball?</h3>
    <p>
      Pickleball is a paddleball sport that combines elements of tennis and badminton. It can be played with two or four
      players who use solid paddles to hit a perforated plastic ball, similar to a whiffleball, over a net. The sport
      shares features of other racquet sports: the dimensions and layout of a badminton court, and a net and rules
      somewhat similar to tennis, with several modifications. We play in the gym.
