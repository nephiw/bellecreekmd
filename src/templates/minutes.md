The proposed shed is larger than the design guidelines allow, but the owners will be placing it so that is will not be visible from the street and will paint it to match their home.  This property is on a seemingly large lot, but part of the lot belongs to the Belle Creek Metropolitan District No. 1 (“District”).  The Committee approved the proposed shed as long as the owners obtain the consent of their adjacent neighbors.

She advised that Waste Management had been unresponsive in changing out the bins to a smaller size.  Laurie Tatlock advised that she had a contact at Waste Management and would see if she could help her get smaller bins.
