        | Belle Creek residents value our neighborhood. We care about the happiness of our neighbors, the stability of the community, 
        | and the value of our homes. These values are the purpose for the Covenant Enforcement Committee.
      p
        | Belle Creek is one of many newer neighborhoods that has a Metropolitan District (also known as a Metro District), instead 
        | of a Homeowners Association. Here is a document that provides some detail on the difference. The most notable difference, 
        | for homeowners, is that payments for common area maintenance, covenant enforcement, and the family center are made as a 
        | part of your annual property tax payment.
      p
        | The Belle Creek Metro District has one five-person board (MDB), which manages the Metro District and empowers the Covenant 
        | Enforcement Committee (CEC). The MDB is responsible for the annual Belle Creek budget and generally fulfilling the requirements
        | of a Metropolitan District, and is currently developer controlled with one resident board member. In contrast, the CEC is 
        | a group of volunteer Belle Creek homeowners whose sole purpose is to work with the Covenant Enforcement Manager (Wolfersberger
        | LLC) and the District Manager (Mulhern MRE) to ensure fair and consistent covenants are in place and people are held to the 
        | appropriate standards. The CEC does this by assessing community concerns, handling violation disputes, and approving/rejecting
        | architectural review requests. All of the decisions of the CEC are upheld by the powers given to the MDB by the Master 
        | Declaration of Covenants and by-laws.
