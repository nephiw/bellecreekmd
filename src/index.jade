        | Belle Creek residents value our neighborhood. We care about the happiness of our neighbors, the stability of the community, and the value of our homes. These values are the purpose for the Covenant Enforcement Committee.

        | Belle Creek is one of many newer neighborhoods that has a Metropolitan District (also known as a Metro District), instead of a Homeowners Association. Here is a document that provides some detail on the difference. The most notable difference, for
        | homeowners, is that payments for common area maintenance, covenant enforcement, and the family center are made as a part of your annual property tax payment.
      p
        | The Belle Creek Metro District has one five-person board (MDB), which manages the Metro District and empowers the Covenant Enforcement Committee (CEC). The MDB is responsible for the annual Belle Creek budget and generally fulfilling the requirements
        | of a Metropolitan District, and is currently developer controlled with one resident board member. In contrast, the CEC is a group of volunteer Belle Creek homeowners whose sole purpose is to work with the Covenant Enforcement Manager (Wolfersberger
        | LLC) and the District Manager (Mulhern MRE) to ensure fair and consistent covenants are in place and people are held to the appropriate standards. The CEC does this by assessing community concerns, handling violation disputes, and approving/rejecting
        | architectural review requests. All of the decisions of the CEC are upheld by the powers given to the MDB by the Master Declaration of Covenants and by-laws.
