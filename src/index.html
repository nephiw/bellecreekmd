      <p>
        As we are sure you are aware, we as a community are dealing with the possible spread of COVID-19. We understand
        that in times like these it is important to share information as quickly as possible and to make decisions that
        are based in fact. With the safety of our community in mind, we have come to the difficult decision to follow
        the lead of Belle Creek Charter School and Commerce City and close the Belle Creek Family Center, effective
        immediately. This includes all events and programs, including child care programs (i.e. Little Feats and before-
        and after-school care), until further notice. We will be sure to post updates on this site, Twitter, and Facebook 
        as soon as information becomes available.
      </p><p>
        We realize that this will inconvenience many of you and we greatly appreciate your understanding while we
        navigate this complicated situation.
      </p><p>
        Thank you, The Belle Creek Family Center

    <h3 class="event-cta">YMCA Contract to End</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Please be advised that the Board of Directors of the Belle Creek Metropolitan District No. 1 has decided not to
        renew the YMCA contract for Family Center Operations. The District will transition to a self-managed facility
        with District employees over the next 60 to 90 days. It is the Districtâ€™s intent to provide the same and/or
        better services and programming to the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know how important the School Age Child Care is to the families using these services and are looking to
        finalize a suitable and affordable replacement. The YMCA has agreed to provide Before and After Care until
        3/31/2020. We will continue to update the Community as our search for the Before and After Care replacement
        moves forward.

    <h3 class="event-cta">About Us</h3>
    <p>
      Belle Creek residents value our neighborhood. We care about the happiness
      of our neighbors, the stability of the community, and the value of our
      homes. These values are the purpose for the Covenant Enforcement
      Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle Creek is one of many newer neighborhoods that has a Metropolitan
      District (also known as a Metro District), instead of a Homeowners
      Association. The most notable difference, for homeowners, is that payments
      for common area maintenance, covenant enforcement, and the Family Center
      are made as a part of your annual property tax payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Belle Creek Metro District has one five-person board (MDB), which
      manages the Metro District and empowers the Covenant Enforcement Committee
      (CEC). The MDB is responsible for the annual Belle Creek budget and
      generally fulfilling the requirements of a Metropolitan District, and is
      home owner controlled with all board members being residents of Belle
      Creek. In contrast, the CEC is a group of volunteer Belle Creek homeowners
      whose sole purpose is to work with the Covenant Enforcement Manager
      (Wolfersberger LLC) and the District Manager (Mulhern MRE) to ensure fair
      and consistent covenants are in place and people are held to the
      appropriate standards. The CEC does this by assessing community concerns,
      handling violation disputes, and approving/rejecting architectural review
      requests. All of the decisions of the CEC are upheld by the powers given
      to the MDB by the Master Declaration of Covenants and by-laws.
