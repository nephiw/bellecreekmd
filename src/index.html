    <h3 class="event-cta">About Us</h3>
    <p>
      Belle Creek residents value our neighborhood. We care about the happiness
      of our neighbors, the stability of the community, and the value of our
      homes. These values are the purpose for the Covenant Enforcement
      Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belle Creek is one of many newer neighborhoods that has a Metropolitan
      District (also known as a Metro District), instead of a Homeowners
      Association. The most notable difference, for homeowners, is that payments
      for common area maintenance, covenant enforcement, and the family center
      are made as a part of your annual property tax payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Belle Creek Metro District has one five-person board (MDB), which
      manages the Metro District and empowers the Covenant Enforcement Committee
      (CEC). The MDB is responsible for the annual Belle Creek budget and
      generally fulfilling the requirements of a Metropolitan District, and is
      home owner controlled with all board members being residents of Belle
      Creek. In contrast, the CEC is a group of volunteer Belle Creek homeowners
      whose sole purpose is to work with the Covenant Enforcement Manager
      (Wolfersberger LLC) and the District Manager (Mulhern MRE) to ensure fair
      and consistent covenants are in place and people are held to the
      appropriate standards. The CEC does this by assessing community concerns,
      handling violation disputes, and approving/rejecting architectural review
      requests. All of the decisions of the CEC are upheld by the powers given
      to the MDB by the Master Declaration of Covenants and by-laws.
