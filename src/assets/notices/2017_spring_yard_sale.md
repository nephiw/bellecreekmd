Looking for some gently used baby clothes, kitchen gadgets, tools, toys, or collectables? On Saturday, June 10th, Belle Creek will be having a community wide yard sale. If you live in the community it will be a great day to sell things you no longer want or need. Even if you don't live in the community, come by and see what we are selling. There should be a lot of great finds available all in one small community.

If you want to register to sell in yard sale and be part of a map of the participants, then fill out this form: https://goo.gl/CyHgvb

We look forward to seeing what people discover in our community!
