# Reservoir Mosquitos?!

Due to the reports of mosquitos near the newly filled Tanabe Reservoir, Denver Water did perform a site visit to further investigate the situation. Staff observed flying insects, identified as non-biting midges, near the water and to a lesser extent near the caretakerâ€™s road. These midges are commonplace throughout the region from spring through fall and are not something that Denver Water would mitigate near a reservoir, as it would require pesticide use.

Additionally, Denver Water staff took water samples in the reservoir to check for mosquito larvae. The good news is that no mosquito larvae was found. This is consistent with what we would expect, as larvae need extremely still bodies of water to survive. In a reservoir the size of Tanabe, there is sufficient movement in the water to prevent larvae from surviving.
