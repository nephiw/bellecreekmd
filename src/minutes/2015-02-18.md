## II. Covenant Enforcement Matters
The Committee discussed the request from the homeowners at 10987 for a fine reduction to facilitate a sale of their property to prevent foreclosure.  The Committee agreed that $4,000 should be escrowed for maintenance before the Covenant Lien is released and allowed that all but $600 of the fines would be written off as long as there were no covenant violations 72 hours after the sale of the property.  

The Committee reviewed the request for a security door at 10788 Dayton Way.  They agreed that the owner needed to pick a design before they could allow the request and suggested that the door be painted to match the trim or the front door.
