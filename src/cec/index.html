    The Covenant Enforcement Committee (CEC) meets once a month on the third wednesday. These meetings are open
    to the public and we encourage the home owners join us if they want to hear what is going on or express
    some other concern. This committee is responsible for covenant enforcement and handling difficult
    design/improvement requests. This is what most people would call our HOA.
  </p>
  <p>The next meeting is on <span class="next-meeting">the third Wednesday of the month</span> at 6:00 pm at the
    Family Center</p>
  <p>For questions regarding covenants and design/improvement requests, email
    <a href="mailto:cec@bellecreekmd.org" target="contact">cec@bellecreekmd.org</a> or Laurie Tatlock at
    <a href="mailto:laurie@mulhernmre.com" target="contact">laurie@mulhernmre.com</a>.
